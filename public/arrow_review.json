      "text": "This fitness app has quickly become an essential part of my workout routine. I love how it tracks each of my sessions and logs them for historical reference. One of the standout features is the body diagram that highlights which muscle groups I’ve hit during the week. It's a great visual way to see where I’ve been focusing and where I need more work. Additionally, the app shows the total volume of weight I’ve lifted, making it easy to track how much I've progressed over time. The data doesn’t stop there—it also breaks down the percentage of body and muscle groups that I tend to hit the most, which is a great way to balance my workouts.\n\nAnother thing that keeps me engaged is how the app calculates and tracks my XP, leveling me up based on my efforts. While it doesn’t necessarily affect my workouts, it’s a fun motivator that tricks my brain into staying consistent—like earning daily points in a game. However, the one drawback I’ve found is that if the app closes or restarts unexpectedly, it prompts me to either resume or end the workout. If I choose \"end the workout,\" that session won’t get logged. I’ve learned to hit \"resume\" and then immediately end the workout to ensure it gets recorded, but that extra step can be annoying.\n\nDespite that small issue, I find this app incredibly motivating. It offers the right balance of data-driven insights, visual tools, and gamified rewards to keep me pushing toward my fitness goals.",

Every time I hit a new level or earn a trophy, it gives me that extra push to stay consistent and aim for even better results.\n\nOne thing I love is how detailed the app gets with your progress. It lets you see how many workouts you’ve done, check out your stats, and even break down how your muscles are being worked over time, which is super cool. Plus, the feature that lets you plan your workouts in advance has been a game-changer for me. It’s so convenient to have everything organized and ready to go, helping me stay on track with my goals.\n\nAnd on top of all that, there’s a great community on the app that makes the whole experience even better. Sharing progress and seeing others’ achievements adds a fun, social aspect to my fitness journey. Overall, I really love this app, and I know I’ll be sticking with it for the long haul.",

I like the social aspect of the app, but I wish there was some way to see your friends workout/be able to import their workouts/community workouts into your preset workouts. It would make it  lot better. Also, it would be nice to able to pull up the previous sessions of an exercise you’re doing. Right now you have to go to your past work outs to find the weights you did, but it would be nice if you could pull up while you’re working out. Otherwise really good!",

Levels has the basics, but RepCount has so much more with the ability to specify warmups/dropsets, add notes to each set, name workouts, show what weights/reps you previously did, allowing you to log multiple workouts per day, specify what time you started and stopped, etc. Obviously this app just launched but if those features which I personally find essential in a workout logging app don't get added, Ill have to stick with RepCount for now. Overall I was super hyped for the app when I saw it on TikTok and I still am but I definitely need some better features before I can start logging my workouts with it.",

I love how easy it is to find what ever workout you want to do, but most importantly you are able to see what types of muscle groups you are working out, unlike other gym apps where they don’t give any detail. I also love how easy it is to log your workouts, it’s super simple and fun. Finally the ability to go back and see your total volume and all the muscles that were active, and showing what muscles weren’t. I have been a supporter since day one and forever will be."
