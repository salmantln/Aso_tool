      "text": "I ADORE this app!! I have a pretty bad tendency to push myself too hard when I workout, and this app has helped me so much to always have an idea of where my body is at and if I need to back off. It helps me stay on track and lets me know when I need to get a workout in (wouldn’t want to lose my streak of course). I especially love that the messages are written like a friend encouraging you to stay with it and keep going without being harsh or feeling shameful. \n\nThe one feature that would make this so much better is if there was a notes section inside each activity after they’ve been completed. When you open the activities tab and select a recently completed activity, I imagine that there could be a “notes” section under “charts” and “perceived exertion.” I usually record my workouts as “strength training” but have a tendency to forget when the last time was that I worked a certain muscle group. As a college student I can’t always go to the gym consistently so I get workouts in when I can. This means I don’t have a set weekly workout schedule and must try to remember the last time I hit legs lol. Having a section for notes would make it so much easier to remember when I did certain workouts, or it could even be used as a way to track weight and reps for the day. I’ve been trying to find a way to track these things either on my own or in an app and it just doesn’t seem like anything exists for this purpose and/or is easy to use. In addition to a notes section, it could be helpful to be able to add a title or subtitle to an activity to more easily identify details about it. This could look like “strength training - Legs” where the original title of the activity remains, but you are able to add quick details to the log. \nI already love this app so much and use it for every workout, but if this feature could be added my love for gentler would just grow even more. I think it would really enhance the already amazing experience and make workout tracking that much easier.",

However, if you are a serious athlete training for a marathon, 15 K, or some other endurance race this is probably not the app for you. I have been training for eight weeks and recently completed a 8 mile run. I took a day off to recover, and then the following day the app said I was pushing too hard, 1 mile in to a 2 mile active recovery run. I know my body and I know when it is time to lay off. Being in tune with my body and whether or not, it’s ready after recovery is something that comes with years of training and experience.\n\nAgain, this is great for those just beginning, or just wanting to learn about their body and it’s response to stress from physical activity.

Other apps use all of the health data that Gentler does but other apps give you a “where is your recovery” today and a goal range.

As someone who has always had a complicated relationship with fitness and who has tried lots of apps to track workouts or provide motivation, this one is by far the best.\n\nGentler Streaks combines the tracking necessities with the appropriate motivation to help you continually achieve your fitness goals. No matter if you’re a novice runner or an expert powerlifter, there’s something in this app for you. It’ll tell you when it’s time to give your body a break and when it’s time to push to the next level.\n\nThe added benefit of Wellbeing, which utilizes sleep tracking data, is something I have yet to explore as I don’t sleep with my watch on, however I’m considering adding that to my routine since I’m so happy with the rest of the functionality in this app.\n\nLove to see the continued updates being pushed frequently and Gentler Streaks getting better and better. Keep up the great work. 🏋🏻",

(I hope soon they’ll be able to bring in the stuff from 2011-2014 too). Would definitely recommend."

    "content": {
      "text": "At my current job, I end up walking between 14k-24k steps (~7-12 miles) in a singular 5-10 hour shift. It’s exhausting both physically and mentally, and there’s obviously no point in me trying to add in an “official” walk/run exercise on any of the days that I’m working.\n\nI was a bit hesitant to try this app out after reading a handful of reviews that talked about how they “wished the activity path would include daily steps” in it’s calculations. Obviously, the only metric I’m actually measuring while at work IS, in fact, my daily step count, alongside occasional heart rate readings and “idle” exercise minutes (~60-150min total) that get tracked outside of official workouts.\n\nDAILY STEPS DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ACTIVITY PATHWAY!\n\nI don’t know how many daily steps those other reviewers were counting, but I can see a major difference in my activity path between the 4 days that I work 9-10 hours, the day I work 5 hours, and the 2 days I get off during the week. The difference is blatantly obviously when you move as much as I do during a work shift.\n\nThis app really makes me feel validated in my physical fitness. I can’t begin to tell you how many times I would come home from work and think to myself something along the lines of, “You shouldn’t be this tired. You’re not doing much of anything worth feeling tired over.” But this app is the first thing to tell me that I’m pushing myself hard, that I’m edging towards the limits of my physical capabilities, that I should take a day to rest and recover (which I sadly can’t because it’s my job).\n\nThe “Go Gentler” workouts are also really nice. I really like the interface on the Apple Watch and how it shows you your HR zones as the default screen during an exercise. (I know Apple’s Exercise app supposedly has a screen for HR zones too but I can’t figure out how to show that while exercising.)\n\nI think my one recommendation/request for this app going forward would be the ability to customize the “Go Gentler” workouts, which doesn’t seem to be an option as far as I can tell. Apple’s Exercise app lets you set up custom workouts with intervals, repetitions, and has the option for warmup and cooldown times. If there was a way to do that with the “Go Gentler” workouts too, I think this app would be nearing perfection.",

You’re not doing much of anything worth feeling tired over.” But this app is the first thing to tell me that I’m pushing myself hard, that I’m edging towards the limits of my physical capabilities, that I should take a day to rest and recover (which I sadly can’t because it’s my job).<br/><br/>The “Go Gentler” workouts are also really nice.

      "cleanHtml": "An app that finally validates my daily movements. At my current job, I end up walking between 14k-24k steps (~7-12 miles) in a singular 5-10 hour shift. It’s exhausting both physically and mentally, and there’s obviously no point in me trying to add in an “official” walk/run exercise on any of the days that I’m working. I was a bit hesitant to try this app out after reading a handful of reviews that talked about how they “wished the activity path would include daily steps” in it’s calculations. Obviously, the only metric I’m actually measuring while at work IS, in fact, my daily step count, alongside occasional heart rate readings and “idle” exercise minutes (~60-150min total) that get tracked outside of official workouts. DAILY STEPS DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ACTIVITY PATHWAY! I don’t know how many daily steps those other reviewers were counting, but I can see a major difference in my activity path between the 4 days that I work 9-10 hours, the day I work 5 hours, and the 2 days I get off during the week. The difference is blatantly obviously when you move as much as I do during a work shift. This app really makes me feel validated in my physical fitness.

      "text": "I’ve tried multiple fitness apps but none of them really stuck. Gentler Streaks is different. It helps keep me motivated while also giving me permission to rest when I need it. I find seeing my Activity Path slowly rise up gives me concrete evidence that I’m improving and motivates me further to keep things going.  \n\nWhen using it on the Apple Watch, it functions very similar to Apple’s native workout app. This I like, because I enjoy the setup of Apple’s workout app and ease of use. However, unlike Apple, it offers you the chance to change your status from active to injured, sick, or on a break. This is what sets it apart because with Apple and other fitness apps, if you lose one day you’re punished for it by losing your streaks, even if you’re injured or sick. Gentler Streaks understands that you shouldn’t be punished for being injured, sick, or simply on vacation. Everyone needs a break sometimes and when you want to start things up again, you can switch back to “active” and Gentler Streaks will give you a fitness plan that won’t burn you out or cause you to reinjure yourself.  \n\nThere are two recommendations I would give to make this app even better.\n\nThe first is that I wish there was a better way to see your progress over time. You get a monthly and yearly recap, but I’d like the option to look at my Activity Path and see how it changes over time whenever I want to. You see the past ten days, and like I said before seeing the difference does help motivate me, but I’d like to zoom out a little further whenever I wanted to.   \n\nThe second is that I’d love to see more articles/insights! There’s a good selection right now, but I love reading these articles and learning more about how I can improve. As a copywriter though, I understand how long it can take to cobble an article together so I understand why there aren’t more right now :)",

Everyone needs a break sometimes and when you want to start things up again, you can switch back to “active” and Gentler Streaks will give you a fitness plan that won’t burn you out or cause you to reinjure yourself.  <br/><br/>There are two recommendations I would give to make this app even better.<br/><br/>The first is that I wish there was a better way to see your progress over time. You get a monthly and yearly recap, but I’d like the option to look at my Activity Path and see how it changes over time whenever I want to. You see the past ten days, and like I said before seeing the difference does help motivate me, but I’d like to zoom out a little further whenever I wanted to.   <br/><br/>The second is that I’d love to see more articles/insights!

      "cleanHtml": "The best fitness app out there and the only one that doesn’t punish you for rest I’ve tried multiple fitness apps but none of them really stuck. Gentler Streaks is different. It helps keep me motivated while also giving me permission to rest when I need it. I find seeing my Activity Path slowly rise up gives me concrete evidence that I’m improving and motivates me further to keep things going. When using it on the Apple Watch, it functions very similar to Apple’s native workout app. This I like, because I enjoy the setup of Apple’s workout app and ease of use. However, unlike Apple, it offers you the chance to change your status from active to injured, sick, or on a break.

I love seeing my numbers in an easy to follow graph and it is always spot on when telling me perhaps I need to rest. Each time I have been feeling sluggish or unwell, the app “knows” based on my data.

After using it for few months here are my notes for improvement: 1. The app almost always says I’m overreaching. I’ve been working out 3x a week for one hour each morning doing moderate - intense weight training g. This has been my routine for months and it still says I’m pushing too hard. Perhaps add a way to adjust zones or customize it based on goals. 2. The zones seem arbitrary. As a user I have absolutely no clue how the graph is calculated or how the data I’m plugging in actually impacts future projections. Adding some reading material for us to reference that gets into the nitty gritty aspects of your algorithm would be helpful. 3.

Another benefit would include automatically giving personalized zones. 4. Minor but an Apple Watch-style ring closing notifications that tell me if I’m on track would be neat. I originally switched to replace that feature. Overall this is a great app and the UI is on point.

I have been using my Apple Watch for 18 months consistently, and gradually increased my workout with a personal trainer. Therefore the “overworking” algorithm appears to have bugs (cited by others, not just me.)\nSince writing the review I have decided to switch back to Apple’s native health app. While the daily rings isn’t ideal, it offers a more robust analysis of my workout patterns.

      "cleanHtml": "I like it BUT I’ve been enjoying the encouragement notifications the app gives me after my workouts but today I’m running late and what do I see? A notification saying “ EXERCISE REMINDER You're about to wave adios to your streak. Start a Go Gentler workout and get back in the game.” Not ok. I don’t know about other people but my willpower works on POSITIVE reinforcement, not negative. Not wanting to feel like a loser is not a motivation for me. Sometimes I need a day off for very good reasons. Telling me I’m about to say “adios” to my streak makes me want to skip a day just to spite you. Reminders like “You got this!” and “You’re doing great, don’t stop!” are what will keep me going. This app is so good otherwise and the negativity just seemed surprising. I hope they can update the app to either ditch the negative reinforcement or give us a choice."

Yet, without doing it, the app informed me I’d already subscribed. So why wasn’t all my data there as well? The app itself is far superior to Apple’s own. Unlike theirs, this one is more realistic. For example, taking time off, including daily chores in one’s workout routines. I’m still unsure subscribing is necessary, nonetheless, I’m going thru with it because I believe in supporting those who have gone to the trouble to put such a fine app together. I also commend the developers for tying in Apples exercise data. It takes awhile to download it into the app, but there it all is. Improvements such as enlarging the timer on each exercise routine. For some reason, heart rate is the app’s #1 priority while exercising. Its there in BIG numbers while the timer is stuck in the top left corner in tiny figures.

As a D1 athlete, I use my Apple Watch almost every day when it comes to seeing the number of calories I burnt, the distance I traveled, my average pace, and now my recovery meter! I wanted to make a recommendation for one of the activities on the app: Outdoor Rowing. Currently, the watch face only displays my calories burnt, the amount of time that has gone by, and my average heart rate.
