      "text": "I’ve started using Training Today in conjunction with the 80/20 zone 2 training methodology for my cycling. The two work very well together. The 80/20 zone 2 methodology means you train 80% of the time at your zone 2 cardio rate, and 20% at your zone 4/5 cardio rate going all out. \n\nFor example, in a 7 day period, you spend four days in zone 2, and 1 day in zones 4/5. In a week’s time, that allows 2 recovery days. I use the Training Today as a guide to see how hard to train. For example, if it has a medium Heart Rate Variability (HRV) score of 5, I’ll train in zone 2 and bike about 30 miles. If the HRV score is 0, I can take a rest day or just bike 15 miles in zone 1. I’ll also make sure there is a rest day before the zones 4/5 push and the HRV score is high enough. Remember zone 2 means endurance training, if you stay in zone 2 for a few hours, you’ll be very tired and the HRV score will show it afterwards. \n\nThe main reason I like Training Today is the way they bound your HRV data into a range between 0 to 10, that’s because everyone’s HRV range is different, and  that range can change as you train over a long period. I’ve also found the HRV read out is quite in tune with what I did during the  training. One important thing to remember is Training Today needs to keep track of your HRV over a period (e.g. 1 month) in order to calibrate the range, that’s because your HRV of 30ms is different from my HRV of the same value. Give the app a try, it’s well worth it.",

The 80/20 zone 2 methodology means you train 80% of the time at your zone 2 cardio rate, and 20% at your zone 4/5 cardio rate going all out. <br/><br/>For example, in a 7 day period, you spend four days in zone 2, and 1 day in zones 4/5. In a week’s time, that allows 2 recovery days. I use the Training Today as a guide to see how hard to train. For example, if it has a medium Heart Rate Variability (HRV) score of 5, I’ll train in zone 2 and bike about 30 miles. If the HRV score is 0, I can take a rest day or just bike 15 miles in zone 1. I’ll also make sure there is a rest day before the zones 4/5 push and the HRV score is high enough. Remember zone 2 means endurance training, if you stay in zone 2 for a few hours, you’ll be very tired and the HRV score will show it afterwards. <br/><br/>The main reason I like Training Today is the way they bound your HRV data into a range between 0 to 10, that’s because everyone’s HRV range is different, and  that range can change as you train over a long period. I’ve also found the HRV read out is quite in tune with what I did during the  training. One important thing to remember is Training Today needs to keep track of your HRV over a period (e.g. 1 month) in order to calibrate the range, that’s because your HRV of 30ms is different from my HRV of the same value. Give the app a try, it’s well worth it.</font><br/>\n            \n            \n            \n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n",

Hiding the basic settings (which were previously available for free) behind an in-app purchase is basically forcing users to pay for the app (so why market it as free….just charge for the app up front). I fully embrace developers, App Store and in-app purchases and will not have an issue paying for something that is useful to me but I disagree completely on moves like this from developers to try to force the user to pay specially if the functionality was provided for free before.",
