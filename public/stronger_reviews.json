Surprising as to which workouts are already in the app; there are some very common workouts not included, but you can easily add any. \n\nFun tracking milestones by comparing weight lifted to real-life things. \n\nWish I could create a group with friends without paying for Pro. Maybe 5 people in a group before you need to pay? Just wanna keep logs on friends. Almost think that would create more competition among us and use th app more…\n\nNo required paywalls to use the app effectively.",
